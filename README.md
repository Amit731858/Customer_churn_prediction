# Customer Churn Prediction

A machine learning project to predict customer churn using historical customer data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project aims to identify customers likely to churn (i.e., cancel their subscription or service) using ML models. It includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training, evaluation, and comparison
- Insights from model performance (e.g., feature importance)

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Clean and preprocess dataset  
- Visualize data distributions and correlations  
- Build and evaluate multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
- Measure performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  
- Interpret the most influential features for churn prediction

- **Source**: [Specify dataset source â€” e.g., Kaggle Telecom Customer Churn Dataset]  
- **Attributes**: Key features such as customer tenure, monthly charges, total charges, contract type, payment method, and internet service.  
- **Structure**:  
  - `data/raw/` â€“ raw dataset  
  - `data/processed/` â€“ preprocessed and cleaned data
